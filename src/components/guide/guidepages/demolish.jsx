            <h2>Demolition</h2>
            <p>From time to time, an empire may need to shift its focus to better cope with its situation - from here, you may spend time demolishing structures to make room for new structures to build.</p>
            <p>Demolishing structures is slower than building (due to the difficulty of disposing of the remains), but some of the original costs can be recovered.</p>
            <p>Unused acres of land can also be dropped from your empire, though the need to relocate citizens and troops, not to mention the paperwork, makes this a slow process.</p>
