<p>Without buildings, organization is impossible - from here, you may spend time and money building structures to strengthen your empire.</p>
<p>As the size of your empire increases you will be able to build structures more quickly, but the cost of building will also increase due to the difficulty of transporting materials.</p>
<p>For a description of what each building does, see <GuideLink text='Structures' page='buildings' />.</p>
