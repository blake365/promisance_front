## React Promisance Front End
This project aims to create a SPA version of the classic browser strategy game, Promisance.
In the game you control an empire. Gain land, build structures, raise an army of troops or wizards, 
and compete to become the largest in the land. 

This project is intended to be used with my typescript promisance back end which is also a work in progress.
