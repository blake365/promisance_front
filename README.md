## React Promisance Front End

NeoPromisance is playable at https://www.neopromisance.com.
This project aims to create a SPA version of the classic browser strategy game, Promisance.
In the game you control an empire. Gain land, build structures, raise an army of troops or wizards, attack other players, sell and buy in player markets, and much more. Compete to become the largest in the land.

This project is intended to be used with my typescript Promisance node server as the back end.
